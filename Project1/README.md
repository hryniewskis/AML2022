## Potential datasets:

- [Tic Tac Toe](https://www.openml.org/d/50) - all results of the game provided that 'x' starts. Target: Game result. Non-standard dataset, exeperimental and probably <ins>unapplicable</ins> for logistic regression.
- [Bank Marketing](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) - Data related with bank marketing companies. Target: Did the client subscribe a term deposit? Many observations: 41188, 20 inputs. Imbalanced.
- [Diabetic retinopathy](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetic+Retinopathy+Debrecen+Data+Set) - Data with features extracted from Messidor image sets. Only numeric variables. Matrix 1151x20, quite balanced at a glance.
- [Horse colic data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Horse+Colic) - Relatively high ratio of columns vs. rows. Target: predicting a horse colic or sth, idk, I'm not a vet. Different feture types. 30% of missing values.


Other potential datasets:
- [Breast Cancer](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29)- quite popular dataset, should be pretty easy to perform experiments on ~30 features ~500 observations. Target: diagnosis (malignant/ benign)
- [Etherneum frauds](https://www.kaggle.com/vagifa/ethereum-frauddetection-dataset) data related to transactions of Etherneum. Imbalanced, only numeric (except for target), ~50 features, ~10k observations. Target: was this transaction a fraud?
