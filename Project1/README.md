## Chosen datasets:

- [Breast Cancer](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29)- quite popular dataset, should be pretty easy to perform experiments on ~30 features ~500 observations. Target: diagnosis (malignant/ benign)
- [Etherneum frauds](https://www.kaggle.com/vagifa/ethereum-frauddetection-dataset) data related to transactions of Etherneum. Imbalanced, only numeric (except for target), ~50 features, ~10k observations. Target: was this transaction a fraud?
- [Bank Marketing](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) - Data related with bank marketing companies. Target: Did the client subscribe a term deposit? Many observations: 41188, 20 inputs. Imbalanced.

- [Superstore sales](https://www.kaggle.com/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final) data related to sales, pretty big dataset which would need some preprocessing, could use a subset. Whole dataset contains ~10k observations and 20 features. Target: Was standard shipmode selected? 
- [Phones data](https://www.kaggle.com/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification) dataset containing basic features of phones. 3000 observations (2 files train and test), 41 features.
